<br />

## Description ðŸ’¬

This project is a React application that displays a list of posts retrieved from an external API. It uses pagination to divide the posts into pages, improving the user experience when navigating through a large amount of data. The application manages its state with React hooks and ensures a smooth loading process while fetching data asynchronously from the API.
